# ml_model_production
This ongoing project is taking a simple model, the classic iris dataset, and 
hosting first locally using flask. In this version of the project you can run 
flask (copy the IP address and add "/apidocs") to get reach the GUI to run
your predictions. The input data for the GET request does regesister 
in the terminal with a 200 request but the predictions do not display. Will 
need to troubleshoot.

Next steps will include storing the dependcies and files in a Docker 
container before deploying on Microsoft Azure.
